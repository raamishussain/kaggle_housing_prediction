# kaggle_housing_prediction

This repository contains an iPython notebook which implements a random forest regressor from Scikit Learn to predict housing prices using the Kaggle housing price dataset. 

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

The notebook goes over some exploratory data analysis as well as data cleaning and pre-processing before implenting the random forest.

Note that there are target labels provided in the test dataset since this dataset is part of a kaggle competition. Therefore the final
checks of the random forest are only applied to the training set and not the testing set. This is something I will work on in the future.
